        <p>I thought the silence would be peaceful.

For the first time in years, the city moved without me. The noise carried on, but I was not there to hear it. A weight I had carried since the beginning was lifted, yet in its place, I felt something else. Something unfamiliar.

The Lounge is quiet. It is small. It is everything I wanted. But echoes of the city still reach me. The voices. The disputes. The shifts in power.

I am not watching, yet I see. I am not listening, yet I hear.

Was I ever truly gone?</p>
